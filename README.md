# upstream-protobuf
upstream-protobuf placeholder for npmjs

- The real package is private and located here: https://github.com/bufbuild/protobuf-es/blob/main/packages/upstream-protobuf/package.json
- Main reason to create that one in NPM is to hold the name and protect it from bad actors who can abuse it and create a malicious NPM package and register it in the public NPM Registry with the same name.
- In case of you are from the bufbuild and would like to register that package please open an issue in that repo and I will drop the name from Public NPM
